## סקר שוק

לפני שמתחילים לעבוד על משחק (או כל מוצר אחר), חשוב לוודא שלא עשו את זה קודם. לא נעים לעבוד סמסטר שלם (או שנה שלמה) על משחק ואז לגלות שכבר יש משחק כזה. 

חפשו בגוגל, בחנות play, בפייסבוק, ובכל מקום אחר שיש לכם גישה אליו, משחקים דומים לרעיון שלכם. ציינו באיזה ביטויי-חיפוש השתמשתם.

זהו את שלושת המשחקים הדומים ביותר. לגבי כל אחד מהם:
Among us https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/
Werewolf Party https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920510/Werewolf_Party/
Werewolf/Mafia https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mafia
The common denomenators of these games are the voting mechanics and the pressence of a two teams competing against each other (Villiageers and werewolfs for example). The difference with our game is that it's everyone for themselves. 

מבין הרכיבים הרשמיים, 
איזה רכיב (או רכיבים) ידגיש ביותר את הייחוד והמקוריות של המשחק שלכם, לעומת משחקים דומים הקיימים בשוק?
